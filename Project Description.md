Project1: ADVANCED FOOTSTEP POWER GENERATIONSYSTEM (2022)
A system designed to capture the typically wasted energy from footsteps and convert it into electrical energy using piezoelectric
sensors The stored energy in the battery can be utilized to charge
smartphones by tapping the authorized RFID card given to the user. Made using Arduino UNO R3 which was interfaced with LCD display, Mini power bank circuit,
RFID reader, Bridge rectifier, Lithium-Ion battery, and piezo sensors.

PROJECT2:AUTOMATED FORKLIFT SYSTEM FOR EFFICIENT OBJECT TRANSPORT IN INDUSTRY (2023) 
The system utilizes the laptop's webcam to read barcodes on packages to determine its size and weight,
and automatically assigns the required number of forklifts to lift it.
It was successfully demonstrated in a physical environment,
with the forklift utilizing a line follower algorithm to navigate to the pick up point, autonomously lift the object, and transport it to the designated location.
The project involved integrating computer vision, a line follower algorithm, and a forklift with lead screw mechanism, enabling
autonomous lifting and dropping of objects.

PROJECT3:FPGA-BASED LINE FOLLOWER ROBOT (2023)
Designed and implemented a line follower robot using DE0- Nano
FPGA board. Developed the control logic in Verilog HDL using Intel Quartus Prime and interfaced it with the motors and sensors of the robot. 

PROJECT4:REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR USING NODE MCU(ESP8266) (2021)
A remote-controlled car that can be controlled wirelessly through a smartphone application. 
Made using Node MCU ESP8266 which was interfaced with motors, Lithium-ion batteries, and L298motor driver.
